Note: These are essentially mini challenges, but that thread seems a bit dead so I am leaving these here. Also, this post is based on a response I made to a thread in /r/learnpython for exercises on list comprehensions, but I figured other people may want to take a crack at them.
Description

Iterating with conditionals is a fundamental programming skill and is often a part of solving other coding problems. The goal of this challenge is to solve several relatively simple iteration exercises as concisely as possible. (These problems can all be solved with one line in many programming languages, but that is not a requirement)
Exercises

Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7
Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them
Count the number of spaces in a string
Remove all of the vowels in a string
Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters
Challenge Exercises:

Count the length of each word in a sentence.
Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)
For all the numbers 1-1000, find the highest single digit any of the numbers is divisible by (1-9)
For example, 14 is divisble by 7, 15 is divisible by 5, 13 is only divisible by 1.
